The dataset includes 7343 images.
Fire-Smokes are annotated in YOLO v5 PyTorch format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 416x416 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 2 versions of each source image:
* Equal probability of one of the following 90-degree rotations: none, clockwise
